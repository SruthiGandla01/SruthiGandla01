## 💡 About Me

🎓 With a strong foundation in data engineering, analytics, and cloud platforms, I’m passionate about designing intelligent systems that address complex, real-world business challenges.

🛠️ I enjoy working across the data stack — from developing predictive models and recommendation systems to deploying scalable ML pipelines and crafting interactive BI dashboards. My recent endeavors include exploring RAG pipelines, real-time monitoring, and LLM integrations to push the boundaries of applied AI.

✨ Tech I love: Python | SQL | MLflow | GCP | BigQuery | Tableau | Power BI | Airflow | Docker | Git | Jupyter

🚀 Always exploring the next frontier in data-driven innovation — whether it’s MLOps, LLMOps, or operationalizing insights at scale.
